# Real-Time Video Call Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the security and authenticity of live video calls by integrating real-time analysis tools. It detects mismatched facial expressions, voice discrepancies, and validates backgrounds using AI technologies. The tool is designed to prevent deepfake manipulation and ensure a trustworthy communication experience.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Facial Expression Analysis**
   - Detects emotions and ensures they align with spoken words and voice tone.

2. **Voice and Speech Synchronization Detection**
   - Analyzes whether the voice matches facial expressions and words.

3. **Background Scanning**
   - Utilizes Google Lens API to analyze and validate objects or scenes in the background during live video calls.

4. **Deepfake Detection**
   - Identifies potential manipulations or mismatched elements in real-time.

5. **Instant Alerts**
   - Provides real-time warnings to users about detected discrepancies.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Seamlessly integrates with major video call platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.
